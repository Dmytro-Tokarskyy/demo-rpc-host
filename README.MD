# Existing Frameworks 
## Mobly
* [Mobly](https://github.com/google/mobly) is a Python-based test framework that specializes in supporting test
cases that require multiple devices, complex environments, or custom hardware
setups.

* [Mobly Snippet Lib](https://github.com/google/mobly-snippet-lib): used for
triggering custom device-side code from host-side Mobly tests. You could use existing
Android libraries like UI Automator and Espresso.

* [Mobly Bundled Snippets](https://github.com/google/mobly-bundled-snippets): a set
of Snippets to allow Mobly tests to control Android devices by exposing a simplified
version of the public Android API suitable for testing.
